Changes:
File .../nanoboard-restore/nanodb.exe-source/PngTransport/Aggregator.cs:
	-	Add code to get the "host_and_folder" "protocol://(domain/IP):PORT/folder"
		and get this from the thread links, like this: "https://0chan.ml/_frct/res/1.html?query=some_query&parameter=value"
	
	-	Get (domain/IP):PORT only (variable "host"), and protocol://(domain/IP):PORT/ without folder (variable "protocol_host_port") - too.
		Now IP:port can be used for threads in "Settings". This will be parsed correctly, if path of PNG is relative, in the response from server.
	
	-	Do this once for each thread, not for each picture.
	
	-	Add regular expression to get picture_host from imageAddress(url in parsed "href") if this contains "http://" or "https://"
	
	-	Block downloading pictures using unknown protocol. For example, "ftp://domain.com/picture.png" in "href" - will be blocked.
	
	-	Change imageAddress by adding pictures relative path from href:
		to "protocol_host_port" (if in href "/images/pic.png" or "./images/pic.png")
		to "host_and_folder" (if in href "../images/pic.png" or "images/pic.png").
	
	-	Add IP-logging attempt prevention:
		if imageAddress contains keyword "logger", or URL shotrers "bit.ly" and "goo.gl" - picture downloading blocked.
		if picture host not thie host of the thread (hard prevention).
		There is possible to comparing protocols+host, because IP-loggers can working on another protocols,
		but if HTTPS board load images using HTTP, this prevention not good.
	
	-	Change m-2ch.ru to m2ch.hk.
	
	-	Add description and second condition as operand for prevent IP-logging, but load pictures from "8ch.net (board)" -> "media.8ch.net (images)".
	
	-	At line 298: Add re-calculating the picture_host for each imageAddress, because many png's from dobrochan
		was been blocked, after downloading PNG from iplogger.org - blocked...

File: .../nanoboard-restore/nanodb.exe-source/Server/DbApiHandler.cs
	-	At line 131: the function was been added parse_number(string string_number), because int.Parse and Int32.Parse not working correctly for me.
	-	At line 150-151: replaced using this. Now last 50 and las 500 messages working good.
	
	-	Add all changes from nanoboard 3.1. See thread http://127.0.0.1:7346/pages/index.html#thread70ca25ba04a241d3b3729611205bf4bb
